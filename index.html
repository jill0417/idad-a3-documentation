      <!-- Guiding Values  -->

        <h2>Guiding Values And Embodiment In The UI</h2>
        <p>
          The core guiding value of Emotion Dice is to create playful and
          reflective digital experiences through accessibility. Music visualises
          the unpredictability of emotions, paired with the animation to create
          a more sensory-rich interaction, and also leverages physical
          movements. Additionally, using this randomness not only as a game
          mechanic but also as a metaphor for the volatile nature of emotion
          supports the cognitive action. The experience supports diverse users
          through eye-catching and visually distinct emotion labels, ensuring
          clarity of purpose and inclusiveness. While expressive typography,
          soft gradients, and sound combine to transform a simple roll of the
          dice into a small act of emotional self-discovery.

      <!--  Design Rationale-->
      <section id="rationale" class="Rationale">
        <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
        <p>
          In my prototype, I used multisensory feedback to guide user
          interaction. When the user clicks a button, the dice image animates as
          it rolls, accompanied by a dice rolling sound and the change of the
          background colour. The emotional title and its matching soundtrack
          appear prominently, the music controls group logically below the song
          title, making the information design clean and letting the users feel
          the result intuitively. The action of rolling the dice is consistent
          with the triggered emotions, and the emotional atmosphere echoes the
          background colour and music, which strengthens the mapping. For
          learnability, there is only one primary button needed to interact,
          which has no unnecessary controls at first glance, making the
          prototype approachable for first-time users.

      <!-- Significant Changes -->
      <section id="changes" class="Changes">
        <h2>Significant Changes</h2>
        <p>
          After receiving the feedback, I implemented some key improvements. One
          of the major changes was creating a fair roll system, which ensures
          that every emotion face is shown up without immediate repeats with a
          random order for two cycles. After the 2 cycles, normal random rolling
          resumes. This can prevent repetition and make sure that they
          experience all the emotions, to make the whole exploration more
          engaging. I also added the background colour transition that tied to
          each emotion and added a dice rolling sound effect to improve the
          immersive and realistic experience. These changes not only improved UI
          usability but also deepened the conceptual consistency of emotional
          change and feedback design.

        <h2>Production Timeline & Time Management</h2>
        <p>
          I first designed the dice-rolling logic and the concept of matching
          emotions, then made a preliminary draft of the basic UI. Next, I laid
          out the overall framework using HTML and focused on functionality with
          JavaScript, establishing dice logic and associating emotions with
          sounds. Once functionality is built, I utilise CSS to design the UI
          and appearance of the prototype, and I even drew my own icons for the
          dice. Based on user feedback, I first optimised the dice rolling loop
          system, added a non-repeating emotion loop to enhance usability, and
          then introduced background colour logic and tested the audio feedback.
          I also adjusted some elements of the UI, like instead of using the
          built-in audio player, I customised the buttons to better align with
          the style of the website and added an alert to warn of the sound
          output and make the website more accessible and clearer. In this
          project, I spent most of my time debugging the dice rolling queue
          logic and figuring out how to let it connect to the audio. I also
          considered adding some other functions like tone control and rolling
          history, but I prioritise completing and refining the main functions.

      <!-- Most Proud Design Aspect -->
      <section id="proud" class="Proud">
        <h2>Most Proud Design Aspect</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m most proud of successfully creating the dice roll animation paired
          with randomised emotion outcomes, which is the core interaction of
          this prototype. I tried to make it feel satisfying and immersive,
          relating to the theme of skeuomorphism. As the dice roll, they animate
          smoothly, playing sound effects and displaying emotions, all
          accompanied by matching music and background colours. This combination
          of visual animation, sound feedback, and emotional effects makes the
          interaction more engaging, simulating rolling the dice, and adds a
          refined touch to the experience, which makes the experience more
          refined and gives me satisfaction when I'm completed.

      <!-- Most Challenging Design Aspect -->
      <section id="challenging" class="Challenging">
        <h2>Most Challenging Design Aspect</h2>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspect of this project was implementing the fair
          roll system, which I had to have each emotion face show up once in a
          random order for two full cycles, then switch to normal random
          behaviour. At first, I didn't understand the logic behind this system
          and was confused about how to prevent duplicates in the scrolling
          queue and ensure that each expression appeared exactly once within a
          cycle. But through the one-on-one guidance of the teacher, I was able
          to break down the problem, gradually understand the logic, and slowly
          build a system through continuous research and experimentation, which
          gives me a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.
